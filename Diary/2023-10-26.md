I want to visit Olympic Park because I do not know what’s there. I guessed there would be a large building symbolizing the Olympics.
The building looks like this : ![[Pasted image 20231009034203.png]]
I searched it online, and it looks just as I imagined. I also found some information about its history. Olympic Park was built in 1988.

If I go there, I might take pictures with the building in the background.
