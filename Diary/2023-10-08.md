It's great that you're working on improving your English skills! Here are some suggestions to help you improve the flow and clarity of your sentences:

1. **Sentence Structure:** Try to structure your sentences with a clear subject, verb, and object. For example:
    
    - "I want to visit Olympic Park because I don't know what's there."
    - "I guessed there would be a large building symbolizing the Olympics."
2. **Use Proper Punctuation:** Use appropriate punctuation to break up your ideas and make your writing easier to follow.
    
    - Instead of "the building is like ![[Pasted image 20231009034203.png]]Correct!" consider: "The building looks like this: ![Pasted image 20231009034203.png]."
    - Use periods to end sentences and question marks for questions.
3. **Capitalization and Spelling:** Ensure that you capitalize proper nouns and use correct spelling. For example, it should be "Olympic Park" and "1988."
    
4. **Tense Consistency:** Keep the tense consistent throughout your sentences. You switched between present and past tense, so it's better to maintain one tense. For example:
    
    - "I just searched it on the internet. The building is like this, and I found information about its history. Olympic Park was built in 1988."
5. **Word Choice:** Use the right words to express your thoughts clearly. For example:
    
    - "Maybe I will take pictures with the background or the building."
    - "I want to visit Olympic Park because I don't know what's there. I believe there's a significant building representing the Olympics. I searched it online, and it looks just as I imagined. I also found some information about its history. Olympic Park was built in 1988. If I go there, I might take pictures with the building in the background."
6. **Consider Cohesion:** Try to link your sentences together logically. This will make your text flow more smoothly. Use connecting words like "because," "and," "if," etc.
    
7. **Practice:** The more you practice, the better you'll get. Consider reading English books, watching English movies, and writing regularly to improve your skills.
    

Keep up the good work, and you'll continue to make progress in your English studies!
